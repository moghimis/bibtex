  abstract = {Lagrangian stochastic (LS) modeling is a common technique in atmospheric
	boundary layer modeling but is relatively new in coastal oceanography.
	This paper presents some fundamental aspects of LS modeling as they
	pertain to oceanography. The theory behind LS modeling is reviewed
	and an introduction to the substantial atmospheric literature on
	the subject is provided. One of the most important properties of
	an LS model is that it maintains an initially uniform distribution
	of particles uniform for all time\&\#8212;the well-mixed condition
	(WMC). Turbulent data for use in an oceanic LS model (LSM) are typically
	output at discrete positions by a general circulation model. Tests
	for the WMC are devised, and it is shown that for inhomogeneous turbulence
	the data output by an oceanic general circulation model is such that
	the WMC cannot be demonstrated. It is hypothesized that this is due
	to data resolution problems. To test this hypothesis analytical turbulence
	data are constructed and output at various resolutions to show that
	the WMC can only be demonstrated if the resolution is high enough
	(the required resolution depending on the inhomogeneity of the turbulence
	data). The output of an LSM represents one trial of possible ensemble
	and this paper seeks to learn the ensemble average properties of
	the dispersion. This relates to the number of particles or trials
	that are performed. Methods for determining the number of particles
	required to have statistical certainty in one\&\#39;s results are
	demonstrated, and two possible errors that can occur when using too
	few particles are shown.},

  abstract = {The aim of this one-dimensional water column study is to combine modified
	versions of three characteristic parameters for periodic tidal flow
	under the influence of a longitudinal buoyancy gradient\&\#8212;the
	horizontal Richardson number, the inverse Strouhal number, and the
	inverse Ekman number\&\#8212;into a parameter space study, including
	constant wind forcing from various directions. It is shown how the
	underlying dynamical equations can be cast into nondimensional form,
	depending mainly on these three nondimensional parameters plus the
	relative wind speed and the wind direction. Idealized model simulations
	are carried out for the whole realistic range of horizontal Richardson
	and inverse Strouhal numbers for various latitudes, showing the amplitude
	of the tidally induced stratification for a wide range of scenarios.
	It is found that classical threshold values for the horizontal Richardson
	number, indicating the switch from periodic stratification to permanent
	stratification, are valid only for special cases, and that this switch
	also strongly depends on the inverse Strouhal number, the inverse
	Ekman number, and the wind vector. The transverse residual flow is
	close to the thermal wind balance for a variety of parameters, and
	nondimensionalized longitudinal residual flow shows the classical
	estuarine exchange flow pattern with little variation in the near-bed
	onshore component. Wind straining is confirmed as an important estuarine
	and coastal process, enhancing estuarine circulation for offshore
	(down estuary) winds and vice versa. Agreement with field data from
	Liverpool Bay is good, including the explanation of a flood tide
	local maximum of the dissipation rate in the upper half of the water
	column. An equation for the second time derivative of the potential
	energy anomaly is derived for quantifying the dynamical processes
	leading to stratification due to the straining of the horizontal
	density gradient.},

	the physical equations are given in a joint notation. Stability functions
	originally suggested by Galperin et al. (1988) are used here with
	slight modifications in order to allow for numerically stable computations
	of free convection. For the k-- models, a flux boundary condition
	for the dissipation rate is tested. In contrast to the classical
	Dirichlet condition, its straightforward discretization allows for
	sufficient accuracy also in three-dimensional models with coarse
	vertical resolution. The models are then applied to idealized situations
	including free convection, wind mixing and stratified steady-state
	boundary layer flow. Finally, the spring development of thermal surface
	stratification as measured during the FLEX'76 experiment is simulated.
	For all these different, partially complex situations, the k-- and

  abstract = {In this comparative study, four different algebraic second-moment
	turbulence closure models are investigated in detail. These closure
	schemes differ in the number of terms considered for the closure
	of the pressure\&\#8211;strain correlations. These four turbulence
	closures result in the eddy-diffusivity principle such that the closure
	assumptions are contained in dimensionless so-called stability functions.
	Their performance in terms of Prandtl number, Monin\&\#8211;Obukhov
	similarity theory, and length scale ratios are first tested against
	data for simple flows. The turbulence closure is then completed by
	means of a k\&\#8211;\&\#949; two-equation model, but other models
	such as the two-equation model by Mellor and Yamada could also be
	used. The concept of the steady-state Richardson number for homogeneous
	shear layers is exploited for calibrating the sensitivity of the
	four models to shear and stable stratification. Idealized simulations
	of mixed layer entrainment into stably stratified flow due to surface
	stress and due to free convection are carried out. For the latter
	experiment, comparison to recent large eddy simulation data is made.
	Finally, the well-known temperature profile data at OWS Papa are
	simulated for an annual cycle. The main result of this paper is that
	the overall performance of the new second-moment closure model by
	Canuto et al.\&\#8212;expressed as nondimensional stability functions\&\#8212;is
	superior compared to the others in terms of physical soundness, predictability,
	computational economy, and numerical robustness.},

  abstract = { In this paper, a time-dependent dynamic equation for the potential
	energy anomaly, [phi], is rigorously derived from dynamic equations
	for potential temperature and salinity, the continuity equation and
	the equation of state for sea water. The terms locally changing [phi]
	are (A) the [phi]-advection, (B) the depth-mean straining, (C) the
	non-mean straining, (D) the vertical advection, (E) the vertical
	mixing, (F) surface and bottom density fluxes, (G) inner sources
	of density e.g. due to absorption of solar radiation and the non-linearity
	of the equation of state, and (H) horizontal divergence of horizontal
	turbulent density fluxes. In order to derive the equation in concise
	form, a vertical velocity (linearly varying with depth) with respect
	to depth-proportional vertical coordinates had to be defined. The
	evaluation of the terms in the [phi]-equation is then carried out
	for a one-dimensional tidal straining study and a two-dimensional
	estuarine circulation study. Comparisons to empirical estimates for
	these terms are made for the one-dimensional study. It is concluded
	that the [phi]-equation provides a general reference for empirical
	bulk parameterisations of stratification and mixing processes in
	estuaries and coastal seas and that it is a tool for complete analysis
	of the relevant terms from numerical models.},

  abstract = { An accurate numerical prediction of the oceanic upper layer velocity
	is a demanding requirement for many applications at sea and is a
	function of several near-surface processes that need to be incorporated
	in a numerical model. Among them, we assess the effects of vertical
	resolution, different vertical mixing parameterization (the so-called
	Generic Length Scale -GLS- set of k-[epsilon], k-[omega], gen, and
	the Mellor-Yamada), and surface roughness values on turbulent kinetic
	energy (k) injection from breaking waves. First, we modified the
	GLS turbulence closure formulation in the Regional Ocean Modeling
	System (ROMS) to incorporate the surface flux of turbulent kinetic
	energy due to wave breaking. Then, we applied the model to idealized
	test cases, exploring the sensitivity to the above mentioned factors.
	Last, the model was applied to a realistic situation in the Adriatic
	Sea driven by numerical meteorological forcings and river discharges.
	In this case, numerical drifters were released during an intense
	episode of Bora winds that occurred in mid-February 2003, and their
	trajectories compared to the displacement of satellite-tracked drifters
	deployed during the ADRIA02-03 sea-truth campaign. Results indicted
	that the inclusion of the wave breaking process helps improve the
	accuracy of the numerical simulations, subject to an increase in
	the typical value of the surface roughness z0. Specifically, the
	best performance was obtained using [alpha]CH = 56,000 in the Charnok
	formula, the wave breaking parameterization activated, k-[epsilon]
	as the turbulence closure model. With these options, the relative
	error with respect to the average distance of the drifter was about
	25% (5.5 km/day). The most sensitive factors in the model were found
	to be the value of [alpha]CH enhanced with respect to a standard
	value, followed by the adoption of wave breaking parameterization
	and the particular turbulence closure model selected.},

	flows seeded with millions of passive inertial particles. The maximum
	Reynolds number is <i>Re</i><sub>\&b.lambda;</sub>\&sim; 200. We
	consider particles much heavier than the carrier flow in the limit
	when the Stokes drag force dominates their dynamical evolution. We
	discuss both the <i>transient</i> and the <i>stationary</i> regimes.
	In the transient regime, we study the growth of inhomogeneities in
	the particle spatial distribution driven by the preferential concentration
	out of intense vortex filaments. In the stationary regime, we study
	the acceleration fluctuations as a function of the Stokes number
	in the range <i>St</i> \&isin; [0.16:3.3]. We also compare our results
	with those of pure fluid tracers (<i>St</i> = 0) and we find a critical
	behavior of inertia for small Stokes values. Starting from the pure
	monodisperse statistics we also characterize polydisperse suspensions
	with a given mean Stokes, .},

  abstract = { This paper describes the parallel simulation of sediment dynamics
	in shallow water. By using a Lagrangian model, the problem is transformed
	to one in which a large number of independent particles must be tracked.
	This results in a technique that can be parallelised with high efficiency.
	We have developed a sediment transport model using three different
	sediment suspension methods. The first method uses a modified mean
	for the Poisson distribution function to determine the expected number
	of the suspended particles in each particular grid cell of the domain
	over all available processors. The second method determines the number
	of particles to suspend with the aid of the Poisson distribution
	function only in those grid cells which are assigned to that processor.
	The third method is based on the technique of using a synchronised
	pseudo-random-number generator to generate identical numbers of suspended
	particles in all valid grid cells for each processor. Parallel simulation
	experiments are performed in order to investigate the efficiency
	of these three methods. Also the parallel performance of the implementations
	is analysed. We conclude that the second method is the best method
	on distributed computing systems (e.g., a Beowulf cluster), whereas
	the third maintains the best load distribution.},

  abstract = { In this article, we explore the application of a set of stochastic
	differential equations called particle model in simulating the advection
	and diffusion of pollutants in shallow waters. The Fokker-Planck
	equation associated with this set of stochastic differential equations
	is interpreted as an advection-diffusion equation. This enables us
	to derive an underlying particle model that is exactly consistent
	with the advection-diffusion equation. Still, neither the advection-diffusion
	equation nor the related traditional particle model accurately takes
	into account the short-term spreading behaviour of particles. To
	improve the behaviour of the model shortly after the deployment of
	contaminants, a particle model forced by a coloured noise process
	is developed in this article. The use of coloured noise as a driving
	force unlike Brownian motion, enables to us to take into account
	the short-term correlated turbulent fluid flow velocity of the particles.
	Furthermore, it is shown that for long-term simulations of the dispersion
	of particles, both the particle due to Brownian motion and the particle
	model due to coloured noise are consistent with the advection-diffusion
	equation.},

  abstract = { The western Baltic is the southernmost part of the transition area
	between North Sea and Baltic Proper. The relatively shallow, strongly
	stratified region is subject to three kinds of external forcing:
	(i) local winds, (ii) barotropic pressure gradient due to sea level
	differences between Baltic and North Sea and (iii) baroclinic pressure
	gradients sustained by freshwater outflow at the sea surface and
	inflow of saline water near the bottom. Owing to the time scale of
	the weather patterns (2 to 4 days) the circulation is mostly governed
	by transients rather than by permanent currents. In order to elucidate
	the dynamics of the area four expeditions have been carried out in
	summer 1983, 1987, 1989 and in autumn 1984 where dense grids of CTD
	stations were worked in the area of the Mecklenburg Bight and Darss
	sill. The experimental findings reveal that easterly winds force
	coastal jets off the german coast associated with coastal upwelling.
	This response can be amplified substantially by pressure gradient
	forcing. Westerly winds generate eddy patterns rather than coastal
	jets. This can be explained by the fact that the cross-circulation
	forced by westerly winds is diminished by the opposite cross-circulation
	driven by pressure gradients, implying only a weak resulting coastal
	up- or downwelling. There are indications that the eddies are generated
	by vortex shedding at topographical features and eddy detachment
	at coastal irregularities.},

  abstract = { Saline water from the North Sea, which is able to enter the deep
	water of the central parts of the Baltic Sea, must unavoidably pass
	two shallow sill areas: the Darss Sill in the Belt Sea area and the
	Drogden Sill in the Sound. Both sills restrict considerably the inflow
	of highly saline and oxygen-rich water known as major Baltic inflows.
	Long-term observations of salinity and current made at light vessels
	Gedser Rev and Drogden in the sill areas are used to evaluate the
	role of the Drogden Sill in major inflow of events. The different
	contributions of the two passages are documented on the basis of
	90 events that took place between 1897 and 1976. Based on the volume
	and salt transports across the two sills the intensity of major inflows
	is re-assessed. The significance of each sill varies considerably
	from event to event. The volume crossing the Drogden Sill during
	major events is, on average, one third of that crossing the Darss
	Sill and usually far more salt enters the Baltic across the latter.
	However, in some cases, the amounts of salt transported across the
	sills are equal (e.g. January 1993) or the amount crossing the Drogden
	Sill is even the larger fraction (e.g. January 1925, January 1908).
	The re-assessed intensity of the 1993 event showed that the inflow
	in January 1993 must be characterized as very strong owing to the
	considerable salt transport across the Drogden Sill.},

  pages = {--},
  abstract = { A variety of algorithms are available for parameterizing the hydrodynamic
	bottom roughness associated with grain size, saltation, bedforms,
	and wave-current interaction in coastal ocean models. These parameterizations
	give rise to spatially and temporally variable bottom-drag coefficients
	that ostensibly provide better representations of physical processes
	than uniform and constant coefficients. However, few studies have
	been performed to determine whether improved representation of these
	variable bottom roughness components translates into measurable improvements
	in model skill. We test the hypothesis that improved representation
	of variable bottom roughness improves performance with respect to
	near-bed circulation, bottom stresses, or turbulence dissipation.
	The inner shelf south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, is the
	site of sorted grain-size features which exhibit sharp alongshore
	variations in grain size and ripple geometry over gentle bathymetric
	relief; this area provides a suitable testing ground for roughness
	parameterizations. We first establish the skill of a nested regional
	model for currents, waves, stresses, and turbulent quantities using
	a uniform and constant roughness; we then gauge model skill with
	various parameterization of roughness, which account for the influence
	of the wave-boundary layer, grain size, saltation, and rippled bedforms.
	We find that commonly used representations of ripple-induced roughness,
	when combined with a wave-current interaction routine, do not significantly
	improve skill for circulation, and significantly decrease skill with
	respect to stresses and turbulence dissipation. Ripple orientation
	with respect to dominant currents and ripple shape may be responsible
	for complicating a straightforward estimate of the roughness contribution
	from ripples. In addition, sediment-induced stratification may be
	responsible for lower stresses than predicted by the wave-current
	interaction model.},

  abstract = {Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics in ocean models are usually
	treated with an advection--diffusion equation for one or more sediment
	size classes coupled to the hydrodynamical part of the model. Numerical
	solution of these additional partial differential equations unavoidably
	introduces numerical diffusion, i.e. in the case of sharp gradients
	the possible occurrence of artificial oscillations and non-positivity.
	A Lagrangian particle-tracking model has been developed to simulate
	short-term SPM dynamics. Modelling individual sediment particles
	allows a straightforward physical interpretation of the processes.
	The tracking of large numbers of individual and independent particles
	(up to 25 million in total in a single sediment class) can be achieved
	on high performance computer clusters, due to efficient parallelisation
	of particle tracking. The movement of the particles is described
	by a stochastic differential equation, which is consistent with the
	advection--diffusion equation. Here, the concentration profile is
	represented by a set of independent moving particles, which are advected
	according to the 3D velocity field, while the diffusive displacements
	of the particles are sampled from a random distribution, which is
	related to the eddy diffusivity field. To account for erosion a new
	parameterisation is proposed. Three numerical particle tracking schemes
	(EULER, MILSTEIN and HEUN) are presented and validated in idealised
	test cases. Finally, the particle tracking algorithms are applied
	to a realistic scenario, a severe winter storm in the East Frisian
	Wadden Sea (southern North Sea). The comparison with observations
	and an Eulerian SPM transport model seems to indicate a somewhat
	better fidelity of the Lagrangian approach.},

  abstract = { The Gulf of Finland is an elongated estuary located in the north-eastern
	extremity of the Baltic Sea. This semi-enclosed sea-area is subject
	to heavy sea traffic, and is one of the main risk areas for oil accidents
	in the Baltic. The continuous development and validation of operational
	particle drift and oil-spill forecasting systems is thus seen to
	be essential for this sea-area. Here, the results of a three-day
	drift experiment in May 2003 are discussed. The field studies were
	performed using GPS-positioned surface floating buoys. The aim of
	this paper is to evaluate how well models can reproduce the drift
	of these buoys. Model simulations, both in forecast and hindcast
	modes, were carried out by three different 3D hydrodynamic models,
	the results of which are evaluated by comparing the calculated drifts
	with observations. These models were forced by HIRLAM (High Resolution
	Limited Area Model) and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
	Forecasts) meteorological forecast fields. The simulated drift of
	the buoys showed a good agreement with observations even when, during
	the study period, a rapidly-changing wind situation was observed
	to affect the investigation area; in this situation the winds turned
	about 100 degrees in half an hour. In such a case it is a very complicated
	task to forecast the drifters' routes: there is a need to regularly
	update the meteorological forcing fields and to use these regularly-updated
	fields throughout the simulations. It is furthermore recommended
	that forecasts should be made using several circulation models and
	several meteorological forecasts, in order to get an overview of
	the accuracy of the forecasted drifts and related differences in
	between the forecasts.},

	many important SDE models satisfy only a local Lipschitz property
	and, since Brownian paths can make arbitrarily large excursions,
	the global Lipschitz-based theory is not directly relevant. In this
	work we prove strong convergence results under less restrictive conditions.
	First, we give a convergence result for Euler-Maruyama requiring
	only that the SDE is locally Lipschitz and that the pth moments of
	the exact and numerical solution are bounded for some p > 2. As an
	application of this general theory we show that an implicit variant
	of Euler-Maruyama converges if the diffusion coefficient is globally
	Lipschitz, but the drift coefficient satisfies only a one-sided Lipschitz
	condition; this is achieved by showing that the implicit method has
	bounded moments and may be viewed as an Euler-Maruyama approximation
	to a perturbed SDE of the same form. Second, we show that the optimal
	rate of convergence can be recovered if the drift coefficient is
	also assumed to behave like a polynomial.},

	the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea through a number of mechanisms. In
	this study, we examine the effects of physical forcing on variations
	in the volume of deep oxygenated water suitable for reproductive
	success of central Baltic cod. Recent research has identified the
	importance of inflows of saline and oxygenated North Sea water into
	the Baltic Sea for the recruitment of Baltic cod. However, other
	processes have been suggested to modify this reproduction volume
	including variations in timing and volume of terrestrial runoff,
	variability of the solubility of oxygen due to variations in sea
	surface temperature as well as the influence of variations in wind
	stress. In order to examine the latter three mechanisms, we have
	performed simulations utilizing the Kiel Baltic Sea model for a period
	of a weak to moderate inflow of North Sea water into the Baltic,
	modifying wind stress, freshwater runoff and thermal inputs. The
	model is started from three-dimensional fields of temperature, salinity
	and oxygen obtained from a previous model run and forced by realistic
	atmospheric conditions. Results of this realistic reference run were
	compared to runs with modified meteorological forcing conditions
	and river runoff. From these simulations, it is apparent that processes
	other than major Baltic inflows have the potential to alter the reproduction
	volume of Baltic cod. Low near-surface air temperatures in the North
	Sea, the Skagerrak/Kattegat area and in the western Baltic influence
	the water mass properties (high oxygen solubility). Eastward oriented
	transports of these well-oxygenated highly saline water masses may
	have a significant positive impact on the Baltic cod reproduction
	volume in the Bornholm Basin. Finally, we analysed how large scale
	and local atmospheric forcing conditions are related to the identified
	major processes affecting the reproduction volume.},

	(LCS) are useful in determining near optimal trajectories for autonomous
	underwater gliders in a dynamic ocean environment. This opens the
	opportunity for optimal path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles
	by studying the global flow geometry via dynamical systems methods.
	Optimal glider paths were computed for a 2-dimensional kinematic
	model of an end-point glider problem. Numerical solutions to the
	optimal control problem were obtained using Nonlinear Trajectory
	Generation (NTG) software. The resulting solution is compared to
	corresponding results on LCS obtained using the Direct Lyapunov Exponent
	method. The velocity data used for these computations was obtained
	from measurements taken in August, 2000, by HF-Radar stations located
	around Monterey Bay, CA. I.}

	estimates often overspill the boundaries and are consequently especially
	biased at and near these edges. In this paper, we consider the alleviation
	of this boundary problem. A simple unified framework is provided
	which covers a number of straightforward methods and allows for their
	comparison: lsquogeneralized jackknifingrsquo generates a variety
	of simple boundary kernel formulae. A well-known method of Rice (1984)
	is a special case. A popular linear correction method is another:
	it has close connections with the boundary properties of local linear
	fitting (Fan and Gijbels, 1992). Links with the lsquooptimalrsquo
	boundary kernels of M{\"u}ller (1991) are investigated. Novel boundary
	kernels involving kernel derivatives and generalized reflection arise
	too. In comparisons, various generalized jackknifing methods perform
	rather similarly, so this, together with its existing popularity,
	make linear correction as good a method as any. In an as yet unsuccessful
	attempt to improve on generalized jackknifing, a variety of alternative
	approaches is considered. A further contribution is to consider generalized
	jackknife boundary correction for density derivative estimation.
	En route to all this, a natural analogue of local polynomial regression
	for density estimation is defined and discussed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a local tricubic interpolation
	scheme in three dimensions that is both C 1 and isotropic. The algorithm
	is based on a specific 64 × 64 matrix that gives the relationship
	between the derivatives at the corners of the elements and the coefficients
	of the tricubic interpolant for this element. In contrast with global
	interpolation where the interpolated function usually depends on
	the whole data set, our tricubic local interpolation only uses data
	in a neighbourhood of an element. We show that the resulting interpolated
	function and its three first derivatives are continuous if one uses
	cubic interpolants. The implementation of the interpolator can be
	downloaded as a static and dynamic library for most platforms. The
	major difference between this work and current local interpolation
	schemes is that we do not separate the problem into three one-dimensional
	problems. This allows for a much easier and accurate computation
	of higher derivatives of the extrapolated field. Applications to
	the computation of Lagrangian coherent structures in ocean data are
	briefly discussed.}

	It is, thus, concluded that normal and regularly occurring flow in

  pages = {481-504},
  abstract = {This paper studies the second-order currents and changes in mean surface
	level which are caused by gravity waves of non-uniform amplitude.
	The effects are interpreted in terms of the radiation stresses in
	the waves. The first example is of wave groups propagated in water
	of uniform mean depth. The problem is solved first by a perturbation
	analysis. In two special cases the second-order currents are found
	to be proportional simply to the square of the local wave amplitude:
	(a) when the lengths of the groups are large compared to the mean
	depth, and (b) when the groups are all of equal length. Then the
	surface is found to be depressed under a high group of waves and
	the mass-transport is relatively negative there. In case (a) the
	result can be simply related to the radiation stresses, which tend
	to expel fluid from beneath the higher waves. The second example
	considered is the propagation of waves of steady amplitude in water
	of gradually varying depth. Assuming no loss of energy by friction
	or reflexion, the wave amplitude must vary horizontally, to maintain
	the flux of energy constant; it is shown that this produces a negative
	tilt in the mean surface level as the depth diminishes. However,
	if the wave height is limited by breaking, the tilt is positive.
	The results are in agreement with some observations by Fairchild.
	
	
	Lastly, the propagation of groups of waves from deep to shallow water
	is studied. As the mean depth decreases, so the response of the fluid
	to the radiation stresses tends to increase. The long waves thus
	generated may be reflected as free waves, and so account for the
	'surf beats’ observed by Munk and Tucker.
	
	
	Generalle speaking, the changes in mean sea level produced by ocean
	waves are comparable with those due to horizontal wind stress. It
	may be necessary to allow for the wave stresses in calculating wind
	stress coefficients.

  abstract = { A three-dimensional, eddy-permitting ocean circulation model with
	implemented bottom boundary layer model and flux-corrected transport
	scheme is used to calculate the pathways and ages of various water
	masses in the Baltic Sea. The agreement between simulated and observed
	temperature and salinity profiles of the period 1980-2004 is satisfactory.
	Especially the renewal of the deep water in the Baltic proper by
	gravity-driven dense bottom flows is better simulated than in previous
	versions of the model. Based upon these model results details of
	the mean circulation are analyzed. For instance, it is found that
	after the major Baltic inflow in January 2003 saline water passing
	the Slupsk Furrow flows directly towards northeast along the eastern
	slope of the Hoburg Channel. However, after the baroclinic summer
	inflow in August/September 2002 the deep water flow spreads along
	the southwestern slope of the Gdansk Basin. Further, the model results
	show that the patterns of mean vertical advective fluxes across the
	halocline that close the large-scale vertical circulation are rather
	patchy. Mainly within distinct areas are particles of the saline
	inflow water advected vertically from the deep water into the surface
	layer. To analyze the time scales of the circulation mean ages of
	various water masses are calculated. It is found that at the sea
	surface of the Bornholm Basin, Gotland Basin, Bothnian Sea, and Bothnian
	Bay the mean ages associated to inflowing water from Kattegat amount
	to 26-30, 28-34, 34-38, and 38-42 years, respectively. Largest mean
	sea surface ages of more than 30 years associated to the freshwater
	of the rivers are found in the central Gotland Basin and Belt Sea.
	At the bottom the mean ages are largest in the western Gotland Basin
	and amount to more than 36 years. In the Baltic proper vertical gradients
	of ages associated to the freshwater inflow are smaller than in the
	case of inflowing saltwater from Kattegat indicating an efficient
	recirculation of freshwater in the Baltic Sea.},

	regional scale, the precision of models based on these two components
	is sufficient for the investigation of coastline scenarios. However,
	on a local scale sediment dynamic is responsible for the evolution
	of coastal structures that alter the coastline in detail considerably.
	The Darss-Zingst Peninsula at the southern coast of the Baltic Sea
	serves as a example for a case study of such a structure. Longshore
	sediment transport driven by waves and responsible for the formation
	of this barrier during the Holocene is simulated for the next 840
	years with the sediment transport modelling software package SEDSIM.
	The main objectives are to test if SEDSIM is a viable tool for the
	modelling of such structures and if the available data basis is suitable
	for this task. Basic data used for the modelling are a recent digital
	elevation model, measured wave time series, a map of sediment distribution,
	and a modelled eustatic scenario. In result, SEDSIM proved to be
	a stable and highly configurable program that can handle the requested
	simulations. Input data have to be improved and must include event
	data like storm surges.},

	scale, including the Baltic Sea. However, simulations with global
	models do not sufficiently resolve the regional impact. Consequently,
	dynamic downscaling methods are being used to convert the results
	obtained in global models to the regional scale. In the present study,
	two regional data sets for greenhouse gas emission scenarios, A1B
	and B1, for the period 1960 to 2100, were used to force transient
	simulations with a 3D ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea. The results
	showed that the expected warming of the Baltic Sea is 1-4 K, with
	a decrease in salinity and a much reduced sea-ice cover in winter.
	In addition, the season favoring cyanobacterial blooms is prolonged,
	with the spring bloom in the Northern Baltic Sea beginning earlier
	in the season, while the oxygen conditions in deep water are expected
	to improve slightly.},

  abstract = { Circulation and transport at the North Flank of Georges Bank are
	studied using a data-assimilative 3-D model of frontal dynamics under
	stratified, tidally energetic conditions over steep topography. The
	circulation model was used in real-time during a cross-frontal transport
	study. Skill is evaluated retrospectively, relative to CTD, ADCP,
	drifter, and fluorescent dye observations. Hydrographic skill is
	shown to be retained for periods of weeks, requiring only initialization
	from routine surveys and proper atmospheric heating subsequently.
	Transport skill was limited by the wind stress input; real-time forecast
	winds taken from an operational meteorological model produced cross-isobath
	Ekman transport which was not observed locally. Retrospective use
	of observed local wind stress removed this cross-frontal bias. The
	contribution of tidal-time motion to the dispersion of a passive
	tracer is assessed using an ensemble of passive particles. The particle
	release simulates an at-sea dye injection in the pycnocline, which
	is followed for four days. Non-advective vertical tracer transport
	is represented as a random walk process sensitive to the local eddy
	diffusivity and its gradient, as computed from the turbulence closure.
	Non-advective horizontal tracer transport is zero for these ensembles.
	Computations of ensemble variance growth support estimates of (Lagrangian)
	horizontal dispersion. Off-bank, ensembles are essentially non-diffusive.
	As an ensemble engages the mixing front, its vertical diffusivity
	rises by 3 orders of magnitude, and horizontal spreading occurs in
	the complex front. The resultant horizontal dispersion is estimated
	from the ensemble variance growth, in along-bank and cross-bank directions.
	It is partitioned, roughly, between that contributed by 3-D advection
	alone, and that initiated by vertical diffusion. Engagement in the
	mixing front occurred in the forecast ensemble as a result of Ekman
	drift produced by an erroneous wind prediction. In the hindcast,
	observed wind left the ensemble non-diffusive and compact, advecting
	parallel to the mixing front and experiencing some advective shear
	dispersion. Lagrangian dispersion is event-specific and both simulations
	here represent credible events with dramatically different ecological
	outcomes. The skill metrics used are less sensitive, indicating that
	metrics tailored to surface-layer phenomena would be more appropriate
	in a data-assimilative context. The hindcast is closer to truth,
	based on first principles (better information). The level 2.5 closure
	used is realistic in the ocean interior; the near-surface processes
	need further refinement, especially as both surface- and bottom-generated
	turbulence affect these events strongly.},

	drift prediction in the ocean remains a challenging task because
	of our yet limited understanding of all processes involved. Hence,
	deterministic approaches to the problem are often limited by empirical
	assumptions on underlying physics. Multi-model hyper-ensemble forecasts,
	which exploit the power of an optimal local combination of available
	information including ocean, atmospheric and wave models, may show
	superior forecasting skills when compared to individual models because
	they allow for local correction and/or bias removal. In this work,
	we explore in greater detail the potential and limitations of the
	hyper-ensemble method in the Adriatic Sea, using a comprehensive
	surface drifter database. The performance of the hyper-ensembles
	and the individual models are discussed by analyzing associated uncertainties
	and probability distribution maps. Results suggest that the stochastic
	method may reduce position errors significantly for 12 to 72 h forecasts
	and hence compete with pure deterministic approaches.},

	ago. One aim is to provide reference or background data for nitrogen,
	phosphorus and chlorophyll, which is required for the implementation
	of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). We assume that the
	situation a century ago serves this purpose well. Model input for
	this long-term simulation study are the regionally differentiated
	riverine and atmospheric nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea, which
	were compiled and calculated for a situation 100 years ago on the
	basis of various literature sources. For the mixed surface layer
	of the open Baltic Sea, we suggest maximum winter concentrations
	for dissolved phosphorus (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) of 0.23-0.35
	(2.7-3.7) mmol/m3. Maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations are between
	1.8 and 2.4 mg/m3. The concentrations of all parameters for different
	coastal waters vary in a wide range, depending on exposure to nutrient
	sources. Our nutrient concentrations for the situation a century
	ago are close to early measured data (1950-1960) and suggest that
	this data is suitable as reference data, as well.},

	deposition and resuspension of sedimentary material in the south-western
	Baltic, based on an upgrade of the sediment transport model described
	in the work of Kuhrts et al. [Kuhrts, C., Fennel, W., Seifert, T.,
	2004. Model studies of transport of sedimentary material in the Western
	Baltic. Journal of Marine Systems 52, 167.]. In the western Baltic,
	a grid spacing of at least 1 nautical mile is required to resolve
	the shallow and narrow bathymetry and the associated current patterns.
	A series of experimental model simulations is carried out with forcing
	data for the year 1993, which include a sequence of storms in January.
	Compared to earlier model versions, a more detailed description of
	potential deposition areas can be provided. The study quantifies
	the influence of enhanced bottom roughness caused by biological structures,
	like mussels and worm holes, provides estimates of the regional erosion
	risks for fine grained sediments, and analyses scenarios of the settling
	and spreading of material at dumping sites. Although the effects
	of changed bottom roughness, as derived from more detailed, re-classified
	sea floor data, are relatively small, the sediment transport and
	deposition patterns are clearly affected by the variation of the
	sea bed properties.},

  abstract = {{Although there has been a surge of interest in density estimation
	in recent years, much of the published research has been concerned
	with purely technical matters with insufficient emphasis given to
	the technique's practical value. Furthermore, the subject has been
	rather inaccessible to the general statistician.The account presented
	in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance,
	in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application
	of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical
	work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those
	with general interests in statistics. The important role of density
	estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion
	of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text.Several contexts
	in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including
	the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant
	analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting,
	projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other
	quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general
	survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method,
	both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail,
	with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and
	on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods,
	which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution,
	and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.}},

	typically used in second-order turbulence models for oceanic flows
	is suggested. Commonly used models, like the k- model and the Mellor-Yamada
	model, can be recovered as special cases of this generic model, and
	thus can be rationally compared. In addition, a method is proposed
	that yields a generalized framework for the calibration of the most
	frequently used class of differential length-scale equations. The
	generic model, calibrated with this method, exhibits a greater range
	of applicability than any of the traditional models. Stratified flows,
	plane mixing layers, and turbulence introduced by breaking surface
	waves are considered besides some classical test cases.},

  abstract = { We are developing a three-dimensional numerical model that implements
	algorithms for sediment transport and evolution of bottom morphology
	in the coastal-circulation model Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS
	v3.0), and provides a two-way link between ROMS and the wave model
	Simulating Waves in the Nearshore (SWAN) via the Model-Coupling Toolkit.
	The coupled model is applicable for fluvial, estuarine, shelf, and
	nearshore (surfzone) environments. Three-dimensional radiation-stress
	terms have been included in the momentum equations, along with effects
	of a surface wave roller model. The sediment-transport algorithms
	are implemented for an unlimited number of user-defined non-cohesive
	sediment classes. Each class has attributes of grain diameter, density,
	settling velocity, critical stress threshold for erosion, and erodibility
	constant. Suspended-sediment transport in the water column is computed
	with the same advection-diffusion algorithm used for all passive
	tracers and an additional algorithm for vertical settling that is
	not limited by the CFL criterion. Erosion and deposition are based
	on flux formulations. A multi-level bed framework tracks the distribution
	of every size class in each layer and stores bulk properties including
	layer thickness, porosity, and mass, allowing computation of bed
	morphology and stratigraphy. Also tracked are bed-surface properties
	including active-layer thickness, ripple geometry, and bed roughness.
	Bedload transport is calculated for mobile sediment classes in the
	top layer. Bottom-boundary layer submodels parameterize wave-current
	interactions that enhance bottom stresses and thereby facilitate
	sediment transport and increase bottom drag, creating a feedback
	to the circulation. The model is demonstrated in a series of simple
	test cases and a realistic application in Massachusetts Bay.},

	The impact of inter-model coupling on regional scale numerical predictions
	of wind-waves, marine circulation, and sediment transport is investigated.
	This is done using the COupled MArine Prediction System (COMAPS),
	which consists of parallel-processing versions of the CH3D-SED circulation
	and sediment transport model, the WAM wind-wave model, and the WCBL
	bottom boundary layer model. COMAPS includes physics couplings between
	wave and current motions at the water surface and wave, current,
	and sediment motions at the marine bed. Adriatic Sea hindcasts are
	discussed. These indicate that the coupling mechanisms have significant
	impacts on coastal water levels, currents, and wave heights, as well
	as basin-wide sediment transport.}

  abstract = { An unstructured-grid procedure for SWAN is presented. It is a vertex-based,
	fully implicit, finite difference method which can accommodate unstructured
	meshes with a high variability in geographic resolution suitable
	for representing complicated bottom topography in shallow areas and
	irregular shoreline. The numerical solution is found by means of
	a point-to-point multi-directional Gauss-Seidel iteration method
	requiring a number of sweeps through the grid. The approach is stable
	for any time step while permitting local mesh refinements in areas
	of interest. A number of applications are shown to verify the correctness
	and numerical accuracy of the unstructured version of SWAN.},
